# Machine-Learning-Nanodegree-Capstone

### The project organization is as follows:

 - predictor: source code for the predictor
 - recommender: source code for the Automatic Trader
 - utils: source code for utility functions and classes
 - notebooks: IPython notebooks
  - dev: Scratchpad notebooks that were used to develop and test the implemented functions. They keep track of the development process but are not intended to be read by general public.
  - prod: Notebooks in which the implemented functions are used with some objective (e.g.: creating datasets, running experiments, testing and validating, etc.)
 - data: This folder is "gitignored", but contains all the data for the project. All of it can be downloaded and created with the implemented functions (in particular, utils/datasources.py contains the "download_capstone_data" function that downloads the initial data; then running the notebooks should do the rest).
